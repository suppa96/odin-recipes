    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      After the lasagna recipe, I got lazy with copy pasting all the
      ingredients, so I looked for the least complex recipe on this website.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups long-grain white rice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons minced onion</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>4 cups hot water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the rice in a colander and rinse thoroughly with cold water; set
        aside.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook the onion in the oil
        for one minute. Stir in the garlic and cook until the garlic is golden
        brown. Add the rice and salt and cook and stir until the rice begins to
        brown. Pour hot water over rice mixture and stir. Reduce heat to low,
        cover the saucepan, and allow to simmer until the water has been
        absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.

    </ol>
